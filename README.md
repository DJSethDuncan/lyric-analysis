# Lyric Analysis

An attempt to help measure songs' lyrical uniqueness. This was built to try to prove a point about dumb song lyrics.

There are a few examples to measure your songs against. A good ratio is 40% and above. An average ratio is closer to 25%.

It literally just returns a ratio of unique words to total words, so, you know, do what you want with that.

## How to use it

* run `npm install`
* run `npm run ng serve`
* navigate to `localhost:4200`

* run `ng build -prod`
* deploy `dist/`
